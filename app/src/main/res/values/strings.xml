  <div><b>16. Over-speeding</b></div>
  <div>
    Bikie vehicles have to be ridden within permissible limits. The speed limit
    for each vehicle is different, and the same is communicated on the booking
    summary page as well as the terms & conditions dialog box that appears
    before making a booking; as well as, in the booking confirmation email after
    the booking is made. Users must be under the speed limit specified for the
    vehicle or the speed limit specified by the governing authority, whichever
    is lesser.
  </div>
  <div>
    All Bikie vehicles have GPS tracking devices; we recommend that the user
    follow speed guidelines – our team gets automated updates on the bikes that
    exceed speed limits and can penalize the user for rash driving up to Rs. 500
    for every third instance of the same.
  </div>

  <div><b>17. Exceeding Km Limit</b></div>
  <div>
    Extra charge is applicable if the Km limit is exceeded by the user. Each
    vehicle has a different charge per km. Which is reflected in the booking
    summary page. The final amount will be conveyed to the customer at the time
    of returning the vehicle by our fleet executive, depending on the extra km
    used.
  </div>

  <div><b>18. Helmet</b></div>
  <div>1 complementary helmet is provided without any charge.</div>
  <div>
    Extra helmets can be added while making short-term bookings. You will get an
    option on the summary page to select the quantity of the helmet.
  </div>
  <div>Customers can rent only 2 helmets per booking.</div>
  <div>
    An additional helmet will be charged as per the rates prescribed by the
    company.
  </div>
  <div>
    If the helmet is damaged or lost, a charge of Rs. 900 will be levied since
    branded helmets will be provided to the user.
  </div>
